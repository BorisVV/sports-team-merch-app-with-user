#Sports team app with users

The user will be able to add items that are sold in a game's day at specific location.

If the user add Items to the database, later it can be changed and updated, the same
when the item is sold, the price will need to be added and the quantity sold.

When the item's choice is not in the db then the user will have to add the item first and then modify the items price and quantity.

The goal too is to add user's verification, like login required etc.
